                         README for extendAnnotation


This file briefly documents the extendAnnotation.py script. Please
note that no documentation is provided for the twoStepPrediction.py
script.

INTRODUCTION:

extendAnnotation takes an alignment col file containing a single
alignment entry which is supplied with a pairing mask as input. Please
see the top README file for explanations of the file format etc.. It
will output a col file which contains an entry for each sequence of
the multiple alignment and will create an individual pairing mask for
each sequence. This is done according to a set of annotation extension
rules (see article mentioned in top README file and the script itself
for details).


DEPENDENCIES:

A path to the py_modules must be set in the header section of the
script.
